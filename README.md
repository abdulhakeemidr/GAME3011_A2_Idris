Game Portfolio Development Assignment 2
 
 This project showcases a lockpicking game mechanic that can be exported and added as an asset package to your unity game project. This game features a number combination locking system with a timer that resets the locks if it runs out.

In the scene, the player spawns with 3 boxes in front of it. The green box indicates a simple combination lock, the yellow box an intermediate combination and the red box a difficult combination lock.
